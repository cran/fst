#' Lightning Fast Serialization of Data Frames for R.
#'
#' Multithreaded serialization of compressed data frames using the 'fst' format.
#' The 'fst' format allows for random access of stored data which can be compressed with the
#' LZ4 and ZSTD compressors.
#'
#' The fst package is based on three C++ libraries:
#'
#' * **fstlib**: library containing code to write, read and compute on files stored in the _fst_ format.
#' Written and owned by Mark Klik.
#' * **LZ4**: library containing code to compress data with the LZ4 compressor. Written and owned
#' by Yann Collet.
#' * **ZSTD**: library containing code to compress data with the ZSTD compressor. Written by
#' Yann Collet and owned by Facebook, Inc.
#'
#' As of version 0.9.8, these libraries are included in the fstcore package, on which fst depends.
#' The copyright notices of the above libraries can be found in the fstcore package.
